        <title>Hello World</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="https://xjp66666.github.io/2026/02/20/hello-world/"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-hexo&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#why-hexo&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; Why Hexo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, when I was in elementary school, I build my first web blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason was because one day when my math teacher was chanting lullaby as usual and I was whispering to my desk mate in order to not fall asleep. I can&#39;t remember why I said that but &amp;quot;I wish I could have my own website. That would be sooo cool&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally he is a computer tech master. Yes. When everyone was forced to study 15 hours a day, he still managed to take some time to learn Coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why not using Hexo?&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;its neat, easy-to-use, and highly customizable. You don&#39;t even have to write a single line of html code cuz Hexo is capable of generating static web pages from your markdown files.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-try&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#first-try&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; First try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then I had no idea what he was talking about and what he meant by &amp;quot;run hexo on github ci and deploy your website on github pages&amp;quot;. So I search for tutorials after getting home and spent the whole night and finally figured out that html and markdown are not programming languages. They are actually mark up languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started building it in the summer vacation that came after my grade 7 school year. It took me almost two weeks. Days and nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time(2022) people still thought that &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; is some kind of advanced tech and it would only exist in sci-fis, although ChatGPT went viral not long after the beginning of 2023. So when I ran into problems, the best I could do was googling. I assume when you&#39;re reading this article, most people have already given up using search engines, but that&#39;s for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I finally finished my masterpiece, I couldn&#39;t describe how thrilled I was cuz it was the first time I literally built something I was proud of, all on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed it off to my classmates, my parents, my teachers, although it seemed nobody really cared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also bought a .site domain for it(expired now, can&#39;t afford it anymore)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already tired of those compliments from others, so nothing could let me down even if no one else saw my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe except for my schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;high-school-entrance-exam&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#high-school-entrance-exam&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; High School Entrance Exam&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might know that every Asian high school student has to get through a nightmare called gaokao, but in fact there is also a high-school-entrance exam which eliminates 50 percent of students who can not go to high school. And of course none of our parents would like their kids to go to high school college where kids learn trades skills and go to workplace. Therefore the test is highly competitive as you imagine. And yeah, The third year of my middle school was tough. I woke up at around 5:30 am and could&#39;t not go to bed until 12 am. 15 hrs of school, 4 hrs of homework and only 20 minutes&#39; lunch was basically my everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, no time to write articles on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-start&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#new-start&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; New Start&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not touch my website since the start of grade 9. It&#39;s been abandoned for 4 years. Lots of things have happened, either good or not, and I&#39;m just amazed by how time flies. I tried a lot of new stuff I would have never though about, I met new friends and yeah, lots of video games and visual novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lot I want to say and record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then, why not restarting my web blog using hexo? I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, why not? It&#39;s neat, easy-to-use, and highly customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new start.&lt;/p&gt;
