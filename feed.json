I can't remember why I said that but &quot;I wish I could have my own website. That would be sooo cool&quot;.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally he is a computer tech master. Yes. When everyone was forced to study 15 hours a day, he still managed to take some time to learn Coding.</p>\n<p>&quot;Why not using Hexo?&quot; he said, &quot;its neat, easy-to-use, and highly customizable. You don't even have to write a single line of html code cuz Hexo is capable of generating static web pages from your markdown files.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-try\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#first-try\">#</a> First try</h3>\n<p>Back then I had no idea what he was talking about and what he meant by &quot;run hexo on github ci and deploy your website on github pages&quot;. So I search for tutorials after getting home and spent the whole night and finally figured out that html and markdown are not programming languages. They are actually mark up languages.</p>\n<p>I started building it in the summer vacation that came after my grade 7 school year. It took me almost two weeks. Days and nights.</p>\n<p>At that time(2022) people still thought that &quot;AI&quot; is some kind of advanced tech and it would only exist in sci-fis, although ChatGPT went viral not long after the beginning of 2023. So when I ran into problems, the best I could do was googling. I assume when you're reading this article, most people have already given up using search engines, but that's for later.</p>\n<p>And when I finally finished my masterpiece, I couldn't describe how thrilled I was cuz it was the first time I literally built something I was proud of, all on my own.</p>\n<p>I posted it online.</p>\n<p>I showed it off to my classmates, my parents, my teachers, although it seemed nobody really cared.</p>\n<p>I also bought a .site domain for it()</p>\n<p>I was already tired of those compliments from others, so nothing could let me down even if no one else saw my work.</p>\n<p>Well, maybe except for my schoolwork.</p>\n",
